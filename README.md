# Chess-v2.0
This is the second iteration of my 2-player chess program. It was coded in Pycharm Community Edition. 

In order to play the game, a player needs only to input the square of the piece that they want to move and then the square that they want to move it to. The square names are in the form of chess notation, such as 'a2' or 'h6' and the complete list is provided whenever a new move input is asked for. 

Side Notes:
Castling is a king move, in which the king must attempt to move two squares horizontally. 
At the start of each turn, the player may attempt to resign the game, offer a draw, or do neither and continue playing. The input function requires typing 'RESIGN' or 'DRAW' to accomplish those corresponding actions.
Simply pressing the 'enter' button is sufficient to continue playing, and the same is true for when the console asks for confirmation to proceed with selecting a piece and moving it to the square chosen. For any move attempted successfully such that the console recognizes it as a valid effort of having a piece move to another square whether it was legal or not, there will be three confirmations asked for.
